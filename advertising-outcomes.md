# Potential Outcomes from Advertising

All advertising aims to drive an outcome, but there are many different possible outcomes advertisers may be 
willing to pay to achieve.
 
 Some types of outcomes are much more direct and immediate than others. Immediate, direct 
 outcomes (e.g. downloading a mobile poker app) are not inherently more valuable than delayed, indirect outcomes 
 (e.g. buying an engagement ring made without "conflict" diamonds). But like any professional,
 marketers face constant pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of money spent on marketing and so will naturally
 tend to prefer channels where it's easier to demonstrate the return on advertising spend over channels where the return is difficult to demonstrate.
 
 This document aims to provide a list of the numerous target outcomes of advertising. This list can hopefully serve 
 as a set of "test cases" to ensure that the privacy-preserving API's of the future web do not unintentionally
 curtail particular channels of advertising by making their desired effects unduly difficult to measure.
